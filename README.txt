To get the prediction file corresponding to our submission called 21th_pred.csv, simply run everything (in order) in the notebook called final.ipynb, without changing folders.
We didn't use the images in our final prediction, so they are not included in the folder.

Running this code as is, for some reason, it fluctuates between the file named 21th_pred.csv (which I did choose as one of my three final submissions) and 20th_pred.csv (which I didn't choose). Either way, you should get a file that scores in the 1.59 range on the private board.
